array of words

set number of guesses

choose a random word

create a word object, split the word and create the letters

replace each letter in the word with an unerscore

show the inquirer  prompt plus remaining guesses

recursion... keep showing until they run out of guesses 
or all letters are showing

    with every corresonding letter to the guess revealed

else numGuesses -- display number of guesses left

if all indeces are letters go to next word 

if numGuesses reaches zero lthen run the game again
with propmt to play again,

play game over yes or no after each word is matched or numGuesses
reaches zero
